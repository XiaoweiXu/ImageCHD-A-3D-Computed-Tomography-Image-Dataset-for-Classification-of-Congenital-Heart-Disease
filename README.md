# ImageCHD-A-3D-Computed-TomographyImage-Dataset-for-Classification-of-CongenitalHeart-Disease

A dataset of A 3D Computed Tomography (CT) image dataset, ImageChD, for classification of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is published. 

ImageCHD contains 110 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images covering most types of CHD, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets. Classification of CHDs requires the identification of large structural changes without any local tissue changes, with limited data. It is an example of a larger class of problems that are quite difficult for current machine-learning based vision methods to solve.

Our dataset includes 110 CT images with labels. The label includes left ventricle (label: 1), right ventricle (label: 2), left atrium (label: 3), right atrium (label: 4), myocardium (label: 5), aorta (label: 6), and pulmonary artery (label: 7).
You notice other labels such 14 etc., you can just ignore them as they are labels corresponding to airways etc.
